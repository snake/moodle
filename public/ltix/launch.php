// TODO: consider access control. currently, ltix doesn't have a "can use/launch a tool" capability.
//  Currently, this endpoint uses: launch.php?id=1
//  But what's to stop a user launching something they cannot see or do not have access to by guessing the URL.
//  Sure, the link (e.g. mod/lti/view) won't be present in the course, but they could figure out the URL and hit launch
//  directly.
//  E.g. where we previously had 'mod/lti:view', how are we now checking the equivalent?
//  placement handler?
//  Maybe like:
//  1. placement allows link create, but placement can also be then turned off/disabled. links should still be able to launch.
//   - placement type implementation (and handler) of course still exists
//  2. ask the placement handler what checks are needed to launch links. even if the placement is disabled, it can make a judgment.
//  3. if handler is registered and cannot be found, it'll error at the 'find handler' level, that's expected.
//  4. if no handler is found, then we're ok to launch.
//  The above seems to suggest we'd benefit from a 'launch tools' capability at the context. Otherwise, it's possible a placement
//  omits any cap checks and anyone from any context can hit launch.php?id=x and launch links from other courses.
//  That, or launch must also be controlled, for now, as a course-only action (despite the API being context centric).
//  This would then allow require_course_login() checks based on the course coming from the context (and error if one can't be found).
//  Later, we could expand launch to permit other contexts and require_capability() etc based on those (e.g. admin launches).
