 * Moodlenet module upgrade code
 *
 * This file keeps track of upgrades to
 * the resource module
 *
 * Sometimes, changes between versions involve
 * alterations to database structures and other
 * major things that may break installations.
 *
 * The upgrade function in this file will attempt
 * to perform all the necessary actions to upgrade
 * your older installation to the current version.
 *
 * If there's something it cannot do itself, it
 * will tell you what you need to do.
 *
 * The commands in here will all be database-neutral,
 * using the methods of database_manager class
 *
 * Please do not forget to use upgrade_set_timeout()
 * before any action that may take longer time to finish.

/**
 * Main upgrade tasks to be executed on Moodle version bump
 *
 * This function is automatically executed after one bump in the Moodle core
 * version is detected. It's in charge of performing the required tasks
 * to raise core from the previous version to the next one.
 *
 * It's a collection of ordered blocks of code, named "upgrade steps",
 * each one performing one isolated (from the rest of steps) task. Usually
 * tasks involve creating new DB objects or performing manipulation of the
 * information for cleanup/fixup purposes.
 *
 * Each upgrade step has a fixed structure, that can be summarised as follows:
 *
 * if ($oldversion < XXXXXXXXXX.XX) {
 *     // Explanation of the update step, linking to issue in the Tracker if necessary
 *     upgrade_set_timeout(XX); // Optional for big tasks
 *     // Code to execute goes here, usually the XMLDB Editor will
 *     // help you here. See {@link http://docs.moodle.org/dev/XMLDB_editor}.
 *     upgrade_main_savepoint(true, XXXXXXXXXX.XX);
 * }
 *
 * All plugins within Moodle (modules, blocks, reports...) support the existence of
 * their own upgrade.php file, using the "Frankenstyle" component name as
 * defined at {@link http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Frankenstyle}, for example:
 *     - {@link xmldb_page_upgrade($oldversion)}. (modules don't require the plugintype ("mod_") to be used.
 *     - {@link xmldb_auth_manual_upgrade($oldversion)}.
 *     - {@link xmldb_workshopform_accumulative_upgrade($oldversion)}.
 *     - ....
 *
 * In order to keep the contents of this file reduced, it's allowed to create some helper
 * functions to be used here in the {@link upgradelib.php} file at the same directory. Note
 * that such a file must be manually included from upgrade.php, and there are some restrictions
 * about what can be used within it.
 *
 * For more information, take a look to the documentation available:
 *     - Data definition API: {@link http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Data_definition_API}
 *     - Upgrade API: {@link http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Upgrade_API}
 *
 * @param int $oldversion
 * @return true
