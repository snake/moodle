Feature: As a teacher in course with relative dates mode enabled
I should be able to create an assignment with a due date relative to the course start date
So that students can enter the course at any time and have a fixed period in which to submit the assignment

  Scenario: As a student the due date for submitting my assignment is relative to my course start date
